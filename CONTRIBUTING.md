# Contributing to Responder

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

Making your first contribution? Follow this [Step-by-step guide to contributing on gitHub](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/)

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License 2.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/skycrafters/responder/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
I'm again borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

# Guidelines

As a newcomer on a large project, it’s easy to experience frustration. Here’s some advice to make your work on Responder more useful and rewarding.

Pick a subject area that you care about, that you are familiar with, or that you want to learn about

You don’t already have to be an expert on the area you want to work on; you become an expert through your ongoing contributions to the code.

# Analyze tickets’ context and history

GitHub issues isn’t an absolute; the context is just as important as the words. When reading issues, you need to take into account who says things, and when they were said. Support for an idea two years ago doesn’t necessarily mean that the idea will still have support. You also need to pay attention to who hasn’t spoken – for example, if an experienced contributor hasn’t been recently involved in a discussion, then a ticket may not have the support required to get into Responder.

# Start small

It’s easier to get feedback on a little issue than on a big one. See the easy pickings.

If you’re going to engage in a big task, make sure that your idea has support first

This means getting someone else to confirm that a bug is real before you fix the issue, and ensuring that there’s consensus on a proposed feature before you go implementing it.

# Be bold! Leave feedback!

Sometimes it can be scary to put your opinion out to the world and say “this ticket is correct” or “this patch needs work”, but it’s the only way the project moves forward. The contributions of the broad Django community ultimately have a much greater impact than that of any one person. We can’t do it without you!

# Wait for feedback, and respond to feedback that you receive

Focus on one or two tickets, see them through from start to finish, and repeat. The shotgun approach of taking on lots of tickets and letting some fall by the wayside ends up doing more harm than good.

# Be patient

It’s not always easy for your ticket or your patch to be reviewed quickly. This isn’t personal. There are a lot of tickets and pull requests to get through.

Keeping your patch up to date is important. Review the ticket on Trac to ensure that the Needs tests, Needs documentation, and Patch needs improvement flags are unchecked once you’ve addressed all review comments.

Finally, a well-timed reminder can help. See contributing code FAQ for ideas here.
